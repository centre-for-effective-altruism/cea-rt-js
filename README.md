# CEA Rope Implementation Challenge
This project contains a partial implementation of a [Rope](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rope_%28data_structure%29). Your challenge is to complete the implementation and make all of the tests pass. 

You may read Wikipedia articles or generic articles about data structures, but please don’t copy and paste or look up existing code for the implementation.

The tests entitled "extra credit" are, well, extra credit. If you are able to do them that's great, but you should focus on the other ones first.

We suggest commenting out all of the tests except for insertion or deletion and then starting with those.

## Installation
Install dependencies with command `yarn install`.

## Tests
Tests can be run with the command `yarn test`.
